    <h2>Who Was Vincent van Gogh?</h2>
      <p>Vincent van Gogh was a post-Impressionist painter whose work — notable for its beauty, emotion and color —
         highly influenced 20th-century art. He struggled with mental illness and remained poor and virtually unknown
         throughout his life.
      </p>
    <h3>Early Life and Family</h3>
        <p> Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. Van Gogh’s father, Theodorus van Gogh,
            was an austere country minister, and his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was a moody artist whose love of
            nature, drawing and watercolors was transferred to her son.
            <br>Van Gogh was born exactly one year after his parents' first son, also named Vincent, was stillborn.
            At a young age — with his name and birthdate already etched on his dead brother's headstone — van Gogh was
            melancholy.
        </p>
    <h3>Theo van Gogh</h3>
        <p>
            The eldest of six living children, van Gogh had two younger brothers (Theo, who worked as an art dealer and
            supported his older brother’s art, and Cor) and three younger sisters (Anna, Elizabeth and Willemien).
            Theo van Gogh would later play an important role in his older brother's life as a confidant, supporter and
            art dealer.
        </p>
    <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
        <p>
            At age 15, van Gogh's family was struggling financially, and he was forced to leave school and go to work.
            He got a job at his Uncle Cornelis' art dealership, Goupil & Cie., a firm of art dealers in The Hague.
            By this time, van Gogh was fluent in French, German and English, as well as his native Dutch.
            <br>In June of 1873, van Gogh was transferred to the Groupil Gallery in London. There, he fell in love with
            English culture. He visited art galleries in his spare time, and also became a fan of the writings of
            Charles Dickens and George Eliot.
            <br>He also fell in love with his landlady's daughter, Eugenie Loyer. When she rejected his marriage
            proposal, van Gogh suffered a breakdown. He threw away all his books except for the Bible, and devoted his
            life to God. He became angry with people at work, telling customers not to buy the "worthless art," and was
            eventually fired.
        </p>
    <h3>Life as a Preacher</h3>
    <p>
        Van Gogh then taught in a Methodist boys' school, and also preached to the congregation. Although raised in a
        religious family, it wasn't until this time that he seriously began to consider devoting his life to the church
        Hoping to become a minister, he prepared to take the entrance exam to the School of Theology in Amsterdam. After
        a year of studying diligently, he refused to take the Latin exams, calling Latin a "dead language" of poor
        people, and was subsequently denied entrance.<br>
        The same thing happened at the Church of Belgium: In the winter of 1878, van Gogh volunteered to move to an
        impoverished coal mine in the south of Belgium, a place where preachers were usually sent as punishment.
        He preached and ministered to the sick, and also drew pictures of the miners and their families, who called him
        "Christ of the Coal Mines."<br>
        The evangelical committees were not as pleased. They disagreed with van Gogh's lifestyle, which had begun to
        take on a tone of martyrdom. They refused to renew van Gogh's contract, and he was forced to find another
        occupation.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding Solace in Art</h3>
    <p>
        In the fall of 1880, van Gogh decided to move to Brussels and become an artist. Though he had no formal art
        training, his brother Theo offered to support van Gogh financially.<br>
        He began taking lessons on his own, studying books like Travaux des champs by Jean-François Millet and Cours de
        dessin by Charles Bargue.<br>
        Van Gogh's art helped him stay emotionally balanced. In 1885, he began work on what is considered to be his
        first masterpiece, "Potato Eaters." Theo, who by this time living in Paris, believed the painting would not be
        well-received in the French capital, where Impressionism had become the trend.<br>
        Nevertheless, van Gogh decided to move to Paris, and showed up at Theo's house uninvited. In March 1886, Theo
        welcomed his brother into his small apartment.<br>
        In Paris, van Gogh first saw Impressionist art, and he was inspired by the color and light. He began studying
        with Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Camille Pissarro and others.<br>
        To save money, he and his friends posed for each other instead of hiring models. Van Gogh was passionate, and
        he argued with other painters about their works, alienating those who became tired of his bickering.<br>
